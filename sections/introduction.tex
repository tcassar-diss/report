\section{Introduction}

In this report, we present \af -- a fine grained, spatially aware, system call
filter for Linux. We begin this report by explaining why production systems use
system call filters, and why we believe that current filtering tooling is
suboptimal. We move onto how we implemented \af, and then to valito validation
and evaluation.

\subsection{Introducing System Call Filtering}

Applications perform dangerous actions, such as mapping memory or forking, via the
\textit{system call} \ac{os} \ac{api}.
