\section{Introduction}

Modern cyber attacks increasingly target critical infrastructure, exploiting
weaknesses in systems software to escalate privilege or exfiltrate sensitive
data. Traditional system call filtering tools like \textit{seccomp} were designed when
applications were smaller and more predictable \cite{arcangeli_seccomp_2005, SYSFILTER}, but modern software's growing
complexity makes these filters less effective \cite{OPTIMUS}. Attackers now have more
opportunities to execute malicious system calls without triggering these system
call filters. 

We aim to address this gap with \af, a \textit{fine-grained system call
filtering solution} written in \ac{bpf}. \af accounts for where in the process's \ac{vma} each
system call was made and applies smaller, more precise whitelists to
different areas of the address space, significantly reducing privilege.

\subsection{Context and Motivation}

System call filtering is used to sandbox programs and is widely used
\cite{BSIDE}. Mobiles \cite{android_seccomp_oreo},
desktop application \cite{flatpak_seccomp_profile}, containers \cite{docker_seccomp}, and emulation tooling all use system call
filtering as a means of reducing process privilege. Production system call
filtering is typically done by applying one single, static filter to an
application. 

When seccomp was released in 2005, this was a sensible choice as
applications were small. \texttt{/bin/true} was \textit{zero} \ac{loc} when
first released, and grew to $\sim2,300$ \ac{loc} by 2012. Similarly,
\texttt{/bin/bash} grew from 11.3KB in Unix v5 (1974) to 1.4MB in Ubuntu 24.04
\cite{SYSFILTER}.

This trend towards larger executables and code bases means that original
assumptions about \textit{application trust} are beginning to break down.
\textit{Software compartmentalisation} \cite{SOK} is a defensive software design approach
which moves past the idea that an application can be treated as a single unit of
trust, and instead decomposes an application into several isolated, mutually
distrusting compartments. This report adds to the growing body of literature on
software compartmentalisation.

\subsection{Aims}

Building upon the concept of software compartmentalisation, this work
proposes \af to enhance system call security through spatial
differentiation based on the process \ac{vma}. Our contribution aims to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement a fully fledged spatial system call filtering solution capable of applying different filtering rules to a system call depending on which area of the \ac{vma} invoked it.
    \item Implement our filtering logic within the Linux kernel, employing techniques such as stack unwinding and \ac{vma} analysis to accurately identify the originating code region for each system call.
    \item Provide a significant level of privilege reduction when compared to seccomp.
    \item Propose a probabilistic privilege reduction metric suitable for fine-grained spatial filtering. % (Reworded slightly for flow)
    \item Implement auxiliary security analysis tooling to apply this metric. % (Reworded slightly for flow)
    \item Validate that our core filtering logic does not impact correct system call functioning.
    \item Assess the runtime performance introduced by \af{} over a diverse set of benchmark applications, compared against seccomp and unfiltered results.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation, Validation, and Evaluation}

To implement \af within the kernel, we use \ac{bpf}. Our core filtering logic
utilises \textit{Linux tracepoints} to inspect every system call made. 
We rely on \ac{bpf} maps, ringbuffers, and helper functions to
implement our filtering logic robustly. The \ac{bpf} program requires configuration,
and mounting to the tracepoint. Furthermore, \af needs to start the filtered
application. We achieve this with a user space ``frontend'' , written in Go.

To validate and evaluate \af, we needed to be able to run apps with \af enabled.
This requires defining \textit{system call whitelists} for each area of these
application's address spaces. Given the project's novelty, no existing
software can do this. As such, we implement a dynamic analysis based
system call whitelist generation tool, \afgen.

We validate \af with a series of carefully crafted example
programs, and use the \ac{ltp} system call test suite to ensure that our core
filtering logic does not lead to broken system calls.  

Following this validation, we conduct security and performance analysis
using five server applications representative of common workloads. Each are
configured to  stress a different \ac{os} subsystem. We quantify security
benefits against  seccomp using a novel probabilistic metric, and
measure performance overhead relative to seccomp and an unfiltered baseline
across these same workloads. 

\subsection{Key Findings}

Our median privilege reduction score was \textit{52.6\%} (exhibited by the
\ac{npb} test suite), with scores ranging from \textit{24.4\%} (Postgres) to
\textit{55.6\%} (\texttt{fio}).

We observed highly variable levels of slowdown across the five benchmarks. While
Nginx processed \textit{25.1\%} fewer requests per second when filtered with \af
over seccomp, \texttt{fio} and \ac{npb} saw no significant slowdown. We conclude
that performance varies highly by workload, with system call frequency and
user space stack depth likely being influencing factors.

The report begins by covering the background knowledge needed to understand
\af's design. We then present a threat model, assumptions, and a high level
design for \af and associated auxiliary tooling. We present implementation
details, validation strategy, and performance/security evaluations. We show how
\af fits into the wider system call/compartmentalisation literature in
Section~\ref{sec:related-works}, and conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
