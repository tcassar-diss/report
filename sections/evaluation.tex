\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section, we show that using addrfilter over seccomp
results in a more secure application with minimal performance penalties. We
look to answer two questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What degree of \textbf{privilege reduction} does addrfilter
        provide when compared to seccomp?
    \item How much does using addrfilter cost in terms of application
        slowdown?
\end{enumerate}

The evaluation presented here is as rigorous as possible. For each
experiment, data was gathered on an unfiltered application, a seccomp-filtered 
application, and an addrfilter-filtered application. This provides relative 
comparisons with the state of the art as well as absolute comparisons with a
baseline. %XXX: GIVE SOME NUMBERS

After running a broad range of benchmarks, we were able to determine that 
system call frequency was the best indicator of application slowdown. Using 
this information, we stressed addrfilter to see how bad the slowdown could
become. We augmented addrfilter with profiling information to determine system
bottlenecks see if a speedup was possible.

A new analysis tool was created: \texttt{syso}. \texttt{syso} gives information
about the number of system calls an application makes, as well as which
libraries are making which system calls. This allows
