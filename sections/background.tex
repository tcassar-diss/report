\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

\af is a project built on a complex stack of systems concepts and technologies
such as process stacks and address spaces, system calls, \ac{bpf}, and software
compartmentalisation. 

This chapter aims to give the reader the minimum background knowledge needed
to understand the motivation, design, and implementation of \af.
Section~\ref{sec:related-works} describes how \af fits into the wider landscape
of system call research.

\subsection{Linux Processes}

Processes are a key concept in the Linux kernel and in system call
filtering -- a process is an \textit{instance of an executing program} 
\cite{LINUX_PROGRAMMING_INTERFACE}. \af is applied to a process and requires 
access to the process's \ac{vma}, stack, and metadata (e.g. \ac{pid}) to 
function.

\subsubsection{Virtual Memory}\label{subsec:bgd-vmem}

Each process accesses memory through the \textit{virtual memory} abstraction.
In the kernel, each process has an \texttt{mm\_struct} which contains a
reference to several \texttt{vm\_area\_struct} structs. 
\texttt{vm\_area\_struct} structs contain information about a contiguous
range of memory addresses, including permissions, relevant start and end
addresses, and, crucially for \af, the file that populated these
memory addresses \cite{love2005linux}. These are called \textit{file backed
memory regions} and are visualised in Figure~\ref{fig:file-backed-vma}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8 \linewidth]{./diagrams/file-backed-vma.drawio.pdf} 
    \caption{A figure showing a file being loaded into a process's \ac{vma} to
    create a \textit{file backed memory region}. One vertical chunk represents
one address range by a \texttt{vm\_area\_struct} struct.}
    \label{fig:file-backed-vma}
\end{figure}

A common example of processes with file-backed regions in their address space
are dynamically linked executables. Dynamically linked executables contain
multiple file-backed memory regions, with different regions associated
with different shared libraries. Dynamically linked executables are mapped
into a processes address space by the linker at runtime, with the
\texttt{\_\_code\_\_} sections of each \ac{elf} binary mapped contiguously 
in memory \cite{DYNAMIC_LINKERS_OS}. One can inspect a process's \ac{vma} from
userspace either through the \texttt{pmap} command line tool or by reading
the contents of the \texttt{/proc/pid/maps} file (where \texttt{pid} is
replaced by the relevant process's \ac{pid}). 

\af splits up applications for system call filtering using these \ac{vma} regions: a system call
whitelist per file-backed memory region.

\subsubsection{Stack Unwinding}

A section of each process's \ac{vma} is dedicated to the stack. The stack in
this context refers to an \acg{os} stack as opposed to the generic data
structure. Recall that a stack manages function calls within a
process, with each function call pushing a stack frame and each return popping
said stack frame.
 
Debugging, observability, and security tools often inspect the process stack
while the program runs through a mechanism called \textit{stack
unwinding} \cite{gregg2014linux, kilroy2022linker}. Stack unwinding involves looking at 
each frame in the user space stack while the process is executing. We
introduce stack unwinding here as \af relies on stack unwinding for part of
its design (Section~\ref{subsubsec:find_syscall}).

\subsection{Linux Security Mechanisms}

Aside from being a convenient way for the \ac{os} to reason about
operations, processes also have security mechanisms inbuilt. Some of these, such as
permission, \acp{uid}/\acp{gid}, and \ac{aslr} are relevant to \af.

\subsubsection{Process Permissions}

In Linux, each process has \iac{uid} and one or more \acp{gid}.
These IDs determine which privileges different processes are allowed - the kernel enforces these
privileges. \af needs to be run with
\iac{uid}/\ac{gid} combination which gives the process the
\texttt{CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN} privilege in order to mount \ac{bpf} programs,
discussed further in Section~\ref{subsec:bgd-bpf}. However, \af needs to ensure
that the applications it launches with its system call filter enabled do not
have access to this permission, as with it, an attacker would be able to
circumvent the filter (as discussed in Section ~\ref{subsubsec:spawning-exec}).

Since \af needs to spawn processes, we must consider \ac{aslr}. \ac{aslr} is a security feature of Linux that makes it harder for
attackers to exploit applications with \ac{rop} \cite{ASLR_GUARD}. When
enabled, the linker will change the addresses of the stack, heap, and file-backed address space regions in the new process's \ac{vma}. Crucially, \ac{aslr}
doesn't affect the address space of forks (as the linker is not involved in
a \texttt{fork()} system call). This allows us to run \af with full \ac{aslr}
enabled for our suite of benchmarks (see 
Section~\ref{subsec:benchmark-selection}), but this may vary by workload.  

The final security feature worth mentioning is the separation of user
space/kernel space. Untrusted applications run in user space, where there is no
direct access to hardware, \ac{io} devices, or the 
network, from user space. On the other hand, kernel space is a more privileged 
environment than user space. The kernel has direct access to hardware, memory, and the
network. As such, one can do a lot of damage from kernel space, including causing
the kernel to crash.

When an application needs to perform a privileged action, such as creating a
file, it must ask the kernel to do the action on the application's behalf. The
application does this by issuing a \textbf{system call}, visualised in
Figure~\ref{fig:syscall-flow}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\scalebox{0.75}{%
\includegraphics{./diagrams/syscall-flow.drawio.pdf}
}
\caption{A diagram showing a simple, generalised system call
flow}\label{fig:syscall-flow}
\end{figure}

Since a system call is a request for a privileged action, analysing system calls
is a well-established idea in systems security. Host-based intrusion detection
systems use system call invocation patterns to look for signs of compromise 
\cite{10.1145/3214304}. System call \textit{filtering} is an established, 
widespread security technique which provides the foundation for \af.

\subsection{System Calls in Existing Security Mechanisms}

Seccomp is a system call filter that has been part of the Linux kernel since
2005 \cite{arcangeli_seccomp_2005}. Seccomp's goal is to restrict the set of
system calls that a process can make, thereby reducing its privilege and making
any attackers who may have compromised the process less able to cause damage.

Despite initial scepticism and slow adoption
\cite{TORVALDS_ANYONE_USES_SECCOMP}, seccomp is widespread today. Android has
used seccomp since 8.0 Oreo, Docker containers are
created with a seccomp filter by default, and Firefox uses it as a means of
sandboxing content processes \cite{android_seccomp_oreo, docker_seccomp,
firefox_seccomp}.

Seccomp is invoked with the \texttt{prctl} system call in one of two modes: strict
or filter. In strict mode, only three system calls are allowed: \texttt{read},
\texttt{write}, and \texttt{exit} \cite{MAN_PAGES_SECCOMP}. This is typically
too strict to be helpful, so the filter mode also exists.

In filter mode, a \ac{bpf} program (plus some metadata) is supplied in the arguments to
\texttt{prctl}. This program is run when a system call occurs, and its logic
determines how to handle the system call. 

Seccomp's man pages entry suggests that seccompBPF may be able to provide fine-grained
system call filtering based on the process's address space, which is what we
are proposing for this project. It's entry states that seccompBPF programs have
access to the ``\texttt{instruction\_pointer} \textit{field}'', which
``\textit{might be useful in conjunction with the use of /proc/pid/maps to
perform checks on which region\dots made the system call}''. 

As noted in
\textcite{yang2024makingsyscallprivilegeright}, seccompBPF does not provide
access to anything other than ptrace registers, which makes it too restrictive
for \af. As we argue in Section~\ref{subsubsec:find_syscall}, the instruction pointer
address alone is insufficient for the fine-grained filtering mechanism we
propose here. Thus, a novel approach built on a different technology is needed
to implement \af. 

\subsection{The (Extended) Berkley Packet Filter}\label{subsec:bgd-bpf}

We decided to use \ac{bpf} to implement \af. \ac{bpf} is a technology
that allows developers to write custom programs which can be \textit{dynamically
loaded} into the kernel to alter the kernel's behaviour \cite{LEARNING_EBPF}.

Writing kernel code without \ac{bpf} is error-prone and typically
requires complex build procedures \cite{UNDERSTANDING_LINUX_KERNEL}. In contrast,
\ac{bpf} programs are easily compiled and loaded into the kernel with the
\texttt{bpf()} system call without any restarts \cite{bpf-man-pages}.

\ac{bpf} programs can be configured to run on many instrumentation points, such
as a system call being triggered. \ac{bpf} also provides a \textit{verifier} which
ensures the  loaded program is safe \cite{LEARNING_EBPF}. This makes it
impossible to cause a kernel panic (or any similarly catastrophic event) when
writing \ac{bpf}, although real-world exploits targeting the verifier have
been seen \cite{BPF_VERIFIER_EXPLOIT}.  

\ac{bpf} achieves this guaranteed safety through the \textit{verifier}. Each
\ac{bpf} program is formally verified to ensure that all loops terminate, no
null dereferences are possible, and that no undefined behaviour can occur in
\iac{bpf} program. 

The verifier makes \ac{bpf} a \textbf{highly restrictive programming language}
and therefore is extremely difficult to write. The language forces the
developer to think about programming differently. Traditional function calls
are impossible -- \ac{bpf} developers use \textit{tail calls} instead. Indefinite
loops are not allowed; the verifier must be able to \textit{prove} that a loop
will terminate. Accessing data structures from kernel or user space must be
done through helper functions, which are convenient but do not always exist. \ac{bpf}
is a rapidly developing, poorly documented language which only adds to its 
difficultly.

\subsubsection{Context and Use Cases}

Despite the development challenges, \ac{bpf} is widely used in industry. Being able to
dynamically load \ac{bpf} programs allows developers to instrument running processes
without changing configuration files or using sidecar containers \cite{SIDECAR}
makes it good for implementing observability tooling.
\ac{bpf} is also often used in networking and firewalls 
\cite{LINUX_NETWORKING_OBSERVABILITY} - a \ac{bpf} program can be loaded 
onto the \ac{xdp} to inspect packets at the 
``\textit{earliest possible point in the network driver}'' 

As discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:bpf-in-security}, \ac{bpf} has been
extensively used for in-kernel security solutions. This is important as it shows
precedent for using \ac{bpf} for systems security applications.

\subsubsection{Structure of \iac{bpf} Program}

\Iac{bpf} program operates by attaching to specific kernel instrumentation
points (like tracepoints or function entries); it runs automatically
whenever kernel execution hits that point. \ac{bpf} maps --versatile key-value stores often accessible from both
the kernel program and user space applications -- store persistent state and configuration. Mechanisms like ringbuffers or perf buffers efficiently send
event data from the kernel to user space, allowing near real-time communication.

\af uses all of these \ac{bpf} concepts except perf buffers.
Section~\ref{sec:implementation} details specifics,
discussing which instrumentation point we attached our program to and why. We
also discuss which maps/ringbuffers we use and the helper functions needed for
our filtering logic.

\subsection{Software Compartmentalisation}

The core idea of \af -- decomposing the process address space to apply 
fine-grained system call restrictions -- is an application of \textit{software
compartmentalisation}.

Software compartmentalisation is a form of defensive programming where an application
is broken down into multiple isolated compartments. Compartments
communicate only over secure interfaces and do not trust each other. An
attacker who manages to compromise one compartment will not be able to gain
access to data or resources assigned to another compartment \cite{SOK}.

Compartmentalisation has proven helpful in containing memory safety issues
\cite{CONFFUZZ}, sandboxing untrusted third parties \cite{ANDROID_SOK} or
unsafe parts of languages \cite{MPK} (e.g. \texttt{unsafe} in Rust 
\cite{rustbook_unsafe}). Compartmentalisation is also an application of the
principle of least privilege to software \cite{PRIVMAN}. As discussed in 
Section~\ref{subsec:objs-assumpions-tm}, we also assume a compartmentalisation
mechanism exists on our host system.

Implementing this form of compartmentalisation requires deep kernel
integration, making \ac{bpf}, with the capabilities discussed previously, a 
suitable tool for the task.
