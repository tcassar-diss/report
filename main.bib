    abstract = {In a contemporary data center, Linux applications often generate
                a large quantity of real-time system call traces, which are not
                suitable for traditional host-based intrusion detection systems
                deployed on every single host. Training data mining models with
                system calls on a single host that has static computing and
                storage capacity is time-consuming, and intermediate datasets are
                not capable of being efficiently handled. It is cumbersome for
                the maintenance and updating of host-based intrusion detection
                systems (HIDS) installed on every physical or virtual host, and
                comprehensive system call analysis can hardly be performed to
                detect complex and distributed attacks among multiple hosts.
                Considering these limitations of current system-call-based HIDS,
                in this article, we provide a review of the development of
                system-call-based HIDS and future research trends. Algorithms and
                techniques relevant to system-call-based HIDS are investigated,
                including feature extraction methods and various data mining
                algorithms. The HIDS dataset issues are discussed, including
                currently available datasets with system calls and approaches for
                researchers to generate new datasets. The application of
                system-call-based HIDS on current embedded systems is studied,
                and related works are investigated. Finally, future research
                trends are forecast regarding three aspects, namely, the
                reduction of the false-positive rate, the improvement of
                detection efficiency, and the enhancement of collaborative
                security.},

%     abstract = {Software vulnerabilities and bugs persist, and so exploits
%                 continue to cause significant damage, particularly by divulging
%                 users' sensitive data to miscreants. Yet the vast majority of
%                 networked applications remain monolithically structured, in stark
%                 contravention of the ideal of least-privilege partitioning. Like
%                 others before us, we believe this state of affairs continues
%                 because today's operating systems offer isolation primitives that
%                 are cumbersome. We present Wedge, a system well suited to the
%                 splitting of complex, legacy, monolithic applications into
%                 fine-grained, least-privilege compartments. Wedge consists of two
%                 synergistic parts: OS primitives that create compartments with
%                 default-deny semantics, which force the programmer to make
%                 compartments' privileges explicit; and Crowbar, a pair of
%                 run-time analysis tools that assist the programmer in determining
%                 which code needs which privileges for which memory objects. By
%                 implementing the Wedge system atop Linux, and applying it to the
%                 SSL-enabled Apache web server and the OpenSSH login server, we
%                 demonstrate that Wedge allows fine-grained compartmentalization
%                 of applications to prevent the leakage of sensitive data, at
%                 acceptable performance cost. We further show that Wedge is
%                 powerful enough to prevent a subtle man-in-the-middle attack that
%                 succeeds on a more coarsely privilege-separated Apache web
%                 server.},

%                 limit privileges leaked or otherwise available to attackers.
%                 However, compartmentalizing applications -- and maintaining that
%                 compartmentalization -- is hindered by ad hoc methodologies and
%                 significantly increased programming effort. In practice,

%                 of the whole program. Moreover, the library may also contain

%                 a privileged program called the monitor and an unprivileged

%                 to the monitor, which results in a smaller and more easily
%                 secured trust base. Previously the privilege separation procedure
%                 , i.e., partitioning one program into the monitor and slave, was
%                 done by hand [18, 28]. We design techniques and develop a tool

%     abstract = {This paper presents SUD, a system for running existing Linux
%                 device drivers as untrusted user-space processes. Even if the
%                 device driver is controlled by a malicious adversary, it cannot
%                 compromise the rest of the system. One significant challenge of
%                 fully isolating a driver is to confine the actions of its
%                 hardware device. SUD relies on IOMMU hardware, PCI express
%                 bridges, and messagesignaled interrupts to confine hardware
%                 devices. SUD runs unmodified Linux device drivers, by emulating a
%                 Linux kernel environment in user-space. A prototype of SUD runs
%                 drivers for Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11 wireless, sound cards, USB
%                 host controllers, and USB devices, and it is easy to add a new
%                 device class. SUD achieves the same performance as an in-kernel
%                 driver on networking benchmarks, and can saturate a Gigabit
%                 Ethernet link. SUD incurs a CPU overhead comparable to existing
%                 runtime driver isolation techniques, while providing much
%                 stronger isolation guarantees for untrusted drivers. Finally, SUD
%                 requires minimal changes to the kernel--just two kernel modules
%                 comprising 4,000 lines of code--which may at last allow the
%                 adoption of these ideas in practice.},
