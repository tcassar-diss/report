    abstract = {In a contemporary data center, Linux applications often generate
                a large quantity of real-time system call traces, which are not
                suitable for traditional host-based intrusion detection systems
                deployed on every single host. Training data mining models with
                system calls on a single host that has static computing and
                storage capacity is time-consuming, and intermediate datasets are
                not capable of being efficiently handled. It is cumbersome for
                the maintenance and updating of host-based intrusion detection
                systems (HIDS) installed on every physical or virtual host, and
                comprehensive system call analysis can hardly be performed to
                detect complex and distributed attacks among multiple hosts.
                Considering these limitations of current system-call-based HIDS,
                in this article, we provide a review of the development of
                system-call-based HIDS and future research trends. Algorithms and
                techniques relevant to system-call-based HIDS are investigated,
                including feature extraction methods and various data mining
                algorithms. The HIDS dataset issues are discussed, including
                currently available datasets with system calls and approaches for
                researchers to generate new datasets. The application of
                system-call-based HIDS on current embedded systems is studied,
                and related works are investigated. Finally, future research
                trends are forecast regarding three aspects, namely, the
                reduction of the false-positive rate, the improvement of
                detection efficiency, and the enhancement of collaborative
                security.},

    abstract = {Nowadays, an increasing number of applications use
                deserialization. This technique, based on rebuilding the instance
                of objects from serialized byte streams, can be dangerous since
                it can open the application to attacks such as remote code
                execution (RCE) if the data to deserialize is originating from an
                untrusted source. Deserialization vulnerabilities are so critical
                that they are in OWASPÕs list of top 10 security risks for web
                applications. This is mainly caused by faults in the development
                process of applications and by flaws in their dependencies, i.e.,
                flaws in the libraries used by these applications. No previous
                work has studied deserialization attacks in-depth: How are they
                performed? How are weaknesses introduced and patched? And for how
                long are vulnerabilities present in the codebase? To yield a
                deeper understanding of this important kind of vulnerability, we
                perform two main analyses: one on attack gadgets, i.e.,
                exploitable pieces of code, present in Java libraries, and one on
                vulnerabilities present in Java applications. For the first
                analysis, we conduct an exploratory large-scale study by running
                256515 &nbsp;experiments in which we vary the versions of
                libraries for each of the 19 publicly available exploits. Such
                attacks rely on a combination of gadgets present in one or
                multiple Java libraries. A gadget is a method which is using
                objects or fields that can be attacker-controlled. Our goal is to
                precisely identify library versions containing gadgets and to
                understand how gadgets have been introduced and how they have
                been patched. We observe that the modification of one
                innocent-looking detail in a class Ð such as making it public Ð
                can already introduce a gadget. Furthermore, we noticed that
                among the studied libraries, 37.5\% are not patched, leaving
                gadgets available for future attacks.For the second analysis, we
                manually analyze 104 deserialization vulnerabilities CVEs to
                understand how vulnerabilities are introduced and patched in
                real-life Java applications. Results indicate that the
                vulnerabilities are not always completely patched or that a
                workaround solution is proposed. With a workaround solution,
                applications are still vulnerable since the code itself is
                unchanged.},

    abstract = {Restricting the system calls available to applications reduces
                the attack surface of the kernel and limits the functionality
                available to compromised applications. Recent approaches
                automatically identify the system calls required by programs to
                block unneeded ones. For servers, they even consider different
                phases of execution to tighten restrictions after initialization
                completes. However, they require access to the source code for
                applications and libraries, depend on users identifying when the
                server transitions from initialization to serving clients, or do
                not account for dynamically-loaded libraries. This paper
                introduces SYSPART, an automatic system-call filtering system
                designed for binary-only server programs that addresses the above
                limitations. Using a novel algorithm that combines static and
                dynamic analysis, SYSPART identifies the serving phases of all
                working threads of a server. Static analysis is used to compute
                the system calls required during the various serving phases in a
                sound manner, and dynamic observations are only used to
                complement static resolution of dynamically-loaded libraries when
                necessary. We evaluated SYSPART using six popular servers on
                x86-64 Linux to demonstrate its effectiveness in automatically
                identifying serving phases, generating accurate system-call
                filters, and mitigating attacks. Our results show that SYSPART
                outperforms prior binary-only approaches and performs comparably
                to source-code approaches.},

    abstract = {A general prerequisite for a code reuse attack is that the
                attacker needs to locate code gadgets that perform the desired
                operations and then direct the control flow of a vulnerable
                application to those gadgets. Address Space Layout Randomization
                (ASLR) attempts to stop code reuse attacks by making the first
                part of the prerequisite unsatisfiable. However, research in
                recent years has shown that this protection is often defeated by
                commonly existing information leaks, which provides attackers
                clues about the whereabouts of certain code gadgets. In this
                paper, we present ASLR-Guard, a novel mechanism that completely
                prevents the leaks of code pointers, and render other information
                leaks (e.g., the ones of data pointers) useless in deriving code
                address. The main idea behind ASLR-Guard is to render leak of
                data pointer useless in deriving code address by separating code
                and data, provide a secure storage for code pointers, and encode
                the code pointers when they are treated as data. ASLR-Guard can
                either prevent code pointer leaks or render their leaks harmless.
                That is, ASLR-Guard makes it impossible to overwrite code
                pointers with values that point to or will hijack the control
                flow to a desired address when the code pointers are
                dereferenced. We have implemented a prototype of ASLR-Guard,
                including a compilation toolchain and a C/C++ runtime. Our
                evaluation results show that (1) ASLR-Guard supports normal
                operations correctly; (2) it completely stops code address leaks
                and can resist against recent sophisticated attacks; (3) it
                imposes almost no runtime overhead (< 1\%) for C/C++ programs in
                the SPEC benchmark. Therefore, ASLR-Guard is very practical and
                can be applied to secure many applications.},

    abstract = {While software applications, programming languages, and hardware
                have changed, operating systems have not. Widely-used commodity
                operating systems are still modelled after the ones designed in
                the seventies. The accumulated burden of backward compatibility
                with the large software ecosystems that run our workloads
                prevents systems from embracing more efficient and disruptive
                designs explored by the system research community.This paper
                advocates a fresh approach to operating system research, where
                innovations are incrementally integrated into operating systems,
                without disrupting existing software, to gradually reshape our
                daily-use systems. The dynamic linker emerges as a pivotal
                element in this transformation process, redefining system
                behavior. The paper outlines specific use cases, covering
                performance enhancements, strengthened security measures,
                streamlined software deployment, and enriched programming
                language abstractions. Additionally, the paper introduces Spidl,
                an experimental modular dynamic linker to facilitate the
                exploration of this promising new research avenue.},
